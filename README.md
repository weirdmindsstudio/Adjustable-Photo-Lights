# Adjustable Photo Lights
## for SineSpace Virtual World

## Content
Once you add the Adjustable Photo Lights folder to your Unity project, you will find several game objects in it:

Adjustable Photo Lights Lamp Type Umbrella

Adjustable Photo Lights Lamp Type Point

Adjustable Photo Lights Lamp Type Square

Adjustable Photo Lights Serverside

Adjustable Photo Lights Server Simulator

## What's what

The first four are furniture items which you will upload to SineSpace later, after a few minor changes, three types of lamps and one serverside .

The last one, "Adjustable Photo Lights Server Simulator", is used instead of the serverside scripting item when you are using it inside of Unity.

## The parts: "Adjustable Photo Lights Lamp Type ...."
These are the lamps, three different styles, but exactly the same functionality.

Take them apart, play with them, extend them, but if you break it... Repair it :)

## The parts: "Adjustable Photo Lights Serverside"
This is the part of the photo lights system that stores the configuration settings on the SineSpace servers.

You have to upload this furniture item, and use the furniture ID it returns for the "Require Server Script" component on the "Seat Adjust" object above!

This item won't show up in your inventory, and you won't have to sell it either. It is just used internally, and with any number of your furniture items!

## The parts: "Adjustable Photo Lights Server Simulator"
Basically a simulator for "Adjustable Photo Lights Serverside". Serverside scripts don't run in Unity, so this is a workaround to make testing easier...
